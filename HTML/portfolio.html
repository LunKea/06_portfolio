            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the week we would learn more about the basics of webdomains through filezilla and HTML structure in VSCode.
            <br>
            <br>
            We did that while having our first assignment/project with the deadline being at the end of the week, which was making a video in randomized groups.

        <h2>The goal for the intro project </h2>
        <div class="project_description">
            <p>During the first week of university, we got assigned randomized groups working on an introduction video, our task was to include everyone in the group in the video and introduce ourselves. 
                <br>
                My group and I was inspired by the movie “Inside Out” made by Disney Pixar where we had a main character experiencing different emotions on the first day of school, and the rest of us would represent different emotions such as:
            </p>    
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Emberassment</li>
            <li>Jealousy</li>
            <li>Sadness</li>
            <li>Joy</li>

        <h2>Learning the process of making videos</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            During the project we learned about various techniques and skills for making a video, we learned about framing techniques, how to brainstorm through briefing and think/creative-discussion into choosing the idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            After choosing an idea we learned about storyboard, moodboard (for video elements) and mindmapping.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also learned about video composition and briefly about copyright on music.

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            It was a really fun project to make a video with other people, as I’ve mostly only experienced making videos on my own, it was a fresh experience doing it with other people and also getting to know my classmates!
            <br>
            <br>
            And it was amazing to learn about the process of making videos, as I am self-taught my knowledge beforehand is quite limited but I was able to learn something new that I can use in my own personal work now, especially framing-techniques
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to watch the video you can do so by clicking this word!

            </div>

            <div class="text_btn">
                <p>
                    Prior to starting in university, I’ve had experience in making Visual Novels with Python as my coding language, so learning HTML and CSS was very fun and interesting. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During this course we learned about:
                </p>
                <li>HTML Setup</li>
                <li>CSS Properties</li>

            <h2>The goal for the first project </h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    For the first project, as an introduction to HTML and CSS, we had to make a website using those type of files, 
                    following wireframes and layout-diagrams that we were handed by the teachers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were also told to make the website mobile-first and make it responsive so i can be on mobile and desktop.
                    <br>
                </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Layout-Diagrams</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            In this course, we were introduced to layout-diagrams, which was my first time seeing but i could easily understand how helpful it is when it comes to coding and found it really handy to have. I learned how to implement this for this project and also how to apply it to future websites/projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            We all had to use the same class, id and layout-diagram. Which helped us in working together in case anyone ran into a problem.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Next to layout-diagrams we learned about wireframes, a concept I’m already familiar with as I’ve made apps before, so I still had something to learn as it was different from when I used it to make apps.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wireframe showcases how the product will look like with headers, paragraphs and images. This wireframe we were handed was heavily focused on grids, as we were also introduced to CSS grids in this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            As practice for CSS grids, we did a lot of CSS grid exercises with hints on how to solve the exercises. In my opinion the exercises helped a lot and prepared me well.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            I also learned about doing mobile-first when it comes to making a responsive website, as it helps out with the process of making a website, since the mobile-version is most likely going to be the simpler version of the website, plus making sure that a burger menu can be implemented later.
            <br>
            <br>
            Doing mobile-first also just helps with transitioning from mobile to desktop, as the mobile-setup can sometime easily transfer to desktop if the website is responsive.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Responsiveness and mediaquery</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            In mobile-first i mentioned making the website responsive, but i didn’t mention how you do that. Through the CSS file you write a mediaquery, which will make a rule dependent on the width or height, but we used width. So dependent on the width of the browser, the layout will change.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future it can later be used for: Desktop into tablet into phone.
            <br>
            <br>
            Media query also helps with changing styles such as font-size and image size depending on what device you view the website on.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Making galleries with CSS and grids</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            With the CSS grid exercises we did, we ended up using them for the gallery of the website, with span and placement within a grid.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was pretty simple to understand, especially because the exercises made me familiar with the concept of how to place and span images across the grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            I noticed some of my classmates struggled with it when it came to making it, they had to end up drawing up the span but I could undestand it to the point of knowing how to make it from the get go, though I do have to admit I did run into some problems when it came to spanning on height.
            <br>

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            As I was completely new to this I did struggle a lot with understanding how CSS grids worked in the beginning but as I kept struggling in the end I learned how to utilize CSS grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            My biggest challenge during this course was actually learning to set up my HTML as I originally made my HTML really weird and complex to the point where no one could help me, so I had to re-do my HTML. But doing so I learned how to use the section and div tag properly and how to make grids!
            <br>
            <br>
            One other challenge I also had throughout this course was using the flex property.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
            Ohter than setting up HTML and CSS grids, we learned a lot of CSS properties which I had a lot of fun with. We learned how to make hover effects, how to link websites through text, image properties in CSS, how to make a footer/header and my favorite part: how to insert fonts.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also learned how to make our website responsive so it can work both on desktop and mobile.
