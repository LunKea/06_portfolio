        <p>The intro week started out with us creating our domain, which you are on now!
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the week we would learn more about the basics of webdomains through filezilla and HTML structure in VSCode.
            <br>
            <br>
            We did that while having our first assignment/project with the deadline being at the end of the week, which was making a video in randomized groups.

        <h2>The goal for the intro project </h2>
        <div class="project_description_intro">
            <p>During the first week of university, we got assigned randomized groups working on an introduction video, our task was to include everyone in the group in the video and introduce ourselves. 
                <br>
                My group and I was inspired by the movie “Inside Out” made by Disney Pixar where we had a main character experiencing different emotions on the first day of school, and the rest of us would represent different emotions such as:
            </p>    
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Emberassment</li>
            <li>Jealousy</li>
            <li>Sadness</li>
            <li>Joy</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Learning the process of making videos</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/intro_week/intro1.png" alt="">
        <p>
            During the project we learned about various techniques and skills for making a video, we learned about framing techniques, how to brainstorm through briefing and think/creative-discussion into choosing the idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            After choosing an idea we learned about storyboard, moodboard (for video elements) and mindmapping.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also learned about video composition and briefly about copyright on music.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            It was a really fun project to make a video with other people, as I’ve mostly only experienced making videos on my own, it was a fresh experience doing it with other people and also getting to know my classmates!
            <br>
            <br>
            And it was amazing to learn about the process of making videos, as I am self-taught my knowledge beforehand is quite limited but I was able to learn something new that I can use in my own personal work now, especially framing-techniques
            <br>
            <br>

                    Prior to starting in university, I’ve had experience in making Visual Novels with Python as my coding language, so learning HTML and CSS was very fun and interesting.

                    <br>
                    During this course we learned about:

            <h2>The goal for the first project </h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    For the first project, as an introduction to HTML and CSS, we had to make a website using those type of files, 
                    following wireframes and layout-diagrams that we were handed by the teachers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were also told to make the website mobile-first and make it responsive so i can be on mobile and desktop.
                    <br>
                </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Layout-Diagrams</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            In this course, we were introduced to layout-diagrams, which was my first time seeing but i could easily understand how helpful it is when it comes to coding and found it really handy to have. I learned how to implement this for this project and also how to apply it to future websites/projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            We all had to use the same class, id and layout-diagram. Which helped us in working together in case anyone ran into a problem.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb1.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb2.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Next to layout-diagrams we learned about wireframes, a concept I’m already familiar with as I’ve made apps before, so I still had something to learn as it was different from when I used it to make apps.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wireframe showcases how the product will look like with headers, paragraphs and images. This wireframe we were handed was heavily focused on grids, as we were also introduced to CSS grids in this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            As practice for CSS grids, we did a lot of CSS grid exercises with hints on how to solve the exercises. In my opinion the exercises helped a lot and prepared me well.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            I also learned about doing mobile-first when it comes to making a responsive website, as it helps out with the process of making a website, since the mobile-version is most likely going to be the simpler version of the website, plus making sure that a burger menu can be implemented later.
            <br>
            <br>
            Doing mobile-first also just helps with transitioning from mobile to desktop, as the mobile-setup can sometime easily transfer to desktop if the website is responsive.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb3.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Responsiveness and mediaquery</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb4.png" alt="">
        <p>
            In mobile-first i mentioned making the website responsive, but i didn’t mention how you do that. Through the CSS file you write a mediaquery, which will make a rule dependent on the width or height, but we used width. So dependent on the width of the browser, the layout will change.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future it can later be used for: Desktop into tablet into phone.
            <br>
            <br>
            Media query also helps with changing styles such as font-size and image size depending on what device you view the website on.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Making galleries with CSS and grids</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            With the CSS grid exercises we did, we ended up using them for the gallery of the website, with span and placement within a grid.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was pretty simple to understand, especially because the exercises made me familiar with the concept of how to place and span images across the grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            I noticed some of my classmates struggled with it when it came to making it, they had to end up drawing up the span but I could undestand it to the point of knowing how to make it from the get go, though I do have to admit I did run into some problems when it came to spanning on height.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb5.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/first_website/firstweb6.png" alt="">
        <p>
            As I was completely new to this I did struggle a lot with understanding how CSS grids worked in the beginning but as I kept struggling in the end I learned how to utilize CSS grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            My biggest challenge during this course was actually learning to set up my HTML as I originally made my HTML really weird and complex to the point where no one could help me, so I had to re-do my HTML. But doing so I learned how to use the section and div tag properly and how to make grids!
            <br>
            <br>
            One other challenge I also had throughout this course was using the flex property.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
            Ohter than setting up HTML and CSS grids, we learned a lot of CSS properties which I had a lot of fun with. We learned how to make hover effects, how to link websites through text, image properties in CSS, how to make a footer/header and my favorite part: how to insert fonts.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also learned how to make our website responsive so it can work both on desktop and mobile.

                <p>
                    Before starting on uni, I made my own website through WIX studio. 
                    But back then I had to remake an ugly website, make it prettier and then get feedback on the newer website vs the old one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile here I could do whatever I want and had to figure everything
                    on my own, which was awesome!

            <h2>The goal for UX project</h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    We had to learnr about making a website from the ground up.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    We then had to make a presentation about
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    our website at the end of the project.

            <p>
                During this project we had to write some sort of dairy to keep track of our progress.
                <br>
                <br>
                I split mine in small notepads on Figma and would make on notepad per week and then write about my days within the weekly-notepad.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s pretty hand to see how you did in earlier projects and compare it to future projects, not only to see your own improvement but also to double-check if you are doing everything you’ve done before in the past.
                <br>
            </p>

        <h2>Choosing a topic and the purpose</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            So the topic/theme of my website was for this Manga (Japanese Comic) that I am a fan of called: “The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At all”
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason why I chose it is because I thought it could be a really fun website to create, as I am heavily involved with the community around the product and it has a very strong and distinctive visual identity which is one of the reason why i’m a fan.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I figured out the purpose of the website should be some sort of guide on how to read it online and how to get the physical version of the manga as well, since this manga just recently released physically when i made the website.
            <br>

        <h2>User-type, target audience & user stories</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux3.png" alt="">
        <p>
            First thing I did after deciding what website to make, I went to look at other websites with the same purpose as mine and stumbled upon a guide on how to buy the manga-series: “LOVE BULLET”. Which is a very similar product to mine as both mangas have the audiences that align with each other, being the LGBTQ community.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then created, user-types on my target audience and user stories.
            <br>

        </div>

        <h2>Early research (Lo-fi)t</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                During the process I made a very early prototype in Figma of the website, and did my first think-aloud test, to see how the website layout I had created already would be perceived and I would make changes accordingly to the feedback I got.

            <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux5.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Once I got my feedback, we then learned about making moodboards based on keywords you chose, in this project we were told to pick 3 key-words.
            <br>
            <br>
            I really like this method as I find it really helpful to narrow down how you want your website/product to look like, especially with the key-words in mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were told to pick 3 but I ended up using 2, as those 2 keywords was the most important to my product’s identity.
            <br>
            <br>
            I ended up making the website based on the key-words: Comic and Music.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Style Tile</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <div>
        <p>
            After getting feedback on the moodboard I would then create a style tile based on how the website would look, showcasing the:
            <ul>
                <li>Header navigation bar</li>
                <li>Header1 and font</li>
                <li>Paragraph and font</li>
                <li>The Buttons(CTAs)</li>
                <li>Layout of the landing page</li>
            </ul>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    I also created the style tile based on a moodboard of the product itself, which included the colors, textures, accents and small details.
                    <br>
                </p>
    </div>
        <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux6.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Finalizing style tile</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux7.png" alt="">
            <p>
                I had two versions of my style tile, so to find out which version to go with I would create a 5-second test, also to see what the visitor’s first impression of the website was.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found the 5-second test to be an amazing data-collection on first impression and what gets noticed first by people who visits the website, it could narrow down if i my intentions correctly or not. As my website had a strong color, I wanted to figure out if people felt like it was very harsh to look at on first impression, because if it was then it wouldn’t be a pleasing experience on a longer visit.
                <br>
            </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Hi-fi prototype</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                After all of my research I would then create a hi-fi prototype of the website, where I would apply all of my CSS styles and write the text that would be on the website too.
                <br>
                <br>
            I then did think-aloud test on my target audience, reaching out to them on X.com and asking for people to participate where I would give them a shout out on my own account after. This felt really amazing as I was actually able to get in contact with my target audience like I wanted to and didn’t just use my social circle for the testing.
                <br>
                <br>
                I got amazing feedback from the community and made changes accordingly to it.
                <br>
            </p>
        <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux8.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>The product (website)</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/UX_asset/ux9.png" alt="">
            <div>
                <p>
                    I would then proceed to make the website itself, where I would apply and pretty much copy-paste everything I made in my Hi-Fi with the feedback in mind.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The website ended up using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>CSS Animations</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And my favorite part, a favicon!
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
            <div class="text_img">
                <p>
                    This project was honestly my favorite, as I got to create a website based on my own interesting which made me really engaged and passionate about this project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I loved every second of it as I also got to interact more with the community I am a part of and got to meet lots of people through it!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though I did struggle one some parts, my menu originally was supposed to have an animation when you clicked on the vinyl, when you clicked on a vinyl that wasn’t lifted up, the current lifted up vinyl would then slide to where you clicked and the previous one would go down. I couldn’t impliment it as I didn’t know how and didn’t have the time to find out either as I ran into a lot of issues with my gallery as well.

            </div>

            <div class="text_btn">
                <p>
                    As I have an interest and hobby involved with videogames I really looked forward to this project, especially because I have coded videogames before, though it was only visual novels, where it’s mostly about the user reading, and the code having if-statements. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I was really excited for this project, as I thought that given my prior experience I would have an adventage in my understanding of Javascript.
                    <br>
                </p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>The goal for animation project</h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to make a game
                    using Javascript.
                    <br>
                    The goal of this project was to make a
                    point and click game, 
                    <br>
                    fulfilling some requirements that were given to us 
                    <br>
                    and learn Javascript basics.
                    <br>
                </p>
        </div>


        <h2>Basics of Javascript</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani1.png" alt="">
        <div>
            <p>
                So as mentioned in the goal of the project, we had to learn how to use Javascript, we first learned how to link our Javascript file and also about how to jump through folders in our html for the src-tag.
                <br>
                Throughout the course we learned these JS tags/skills:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Console Log</li>
                <li>Const</li>
                <li>Fucntion
                <li>Queryselector</li>
                <li>classList.add/remove</li>
                <li>eventListeners</li>
                <li>if statements</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Vector art with Illustrator</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            During this project we started to use our Adobe Illustrator and learned about the pen tool to make vector art, that we would be using for our game through .SVG files so it wouldn’t get pixelated if we were to up/down-scale the image.
            <br>
            <br>
            The useage of .SVG file was amazing as our illustrations was now vector based so nothing would be lost on the picture quality when we’d change the size of it.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani2.png" alt="">
        </div>


        <h2>State Machine Diagram</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani3.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Since we were working on a game we had to learn how to use two diagrams.
<br>
<br>
            One of them being State Machine Diagram.
    <br>
    <br>        
            For the project’s context, the Sate Machine Diagram was used to guide us on what would happen when you interacted with each element that would be in our game.
        <br>
        <br>    
            It was also used as a tool for us to get help from our teachers if we ran into any problems. The diagram was really useful to have an overview of each element in the game
        <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Activity Diagram(Lo-fi)t</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                The second diagram we learned to use was the Activity Diagram.
                <br>
                <br>
                Activity Diagram is quite similar to State Machine Diagram, but it was made more on a non-coded way. As in it wouldn’t have any coding on the diagram and only show wat would be happening as an user.
                <br>
            </p>

        <h2>Insperation</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani5.png" alt="">
        <p>
            The inspiration for my game was the hit-classic game Plants VS Zombies.
            <br>
            <br>
            But I decided to take my own spin on the visuals with implementing the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami’s art-style in my game.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Paper prototype</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <div>
        <p>
            For this project we had to make a paper prototype for our game.
                <br>
                <br>
                The benefit of making a paper-prototype compared to a digital one is that you make it a lot caster and show-case it a lot faster.
                <br>    
            </p>
                </div>
        <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani6.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Hand-sketch</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani7.png" alt="">
            <p>
                For my visuals, I would do hand-sketching and then take a picture of my drawings, place it in illustrator and then trace it with the pen-tool to turn my hand-sketch into a vector-based drawing.
                <br>
                <br>
It helped a lot since I am not too familiar with making drawings ground up with the pen-tool.
<br>
            </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Style Tile</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                For my style-tile of the game, i based it on my moob-board which had the three keywords: “Cute, Fun and Colorful”, “Modern Flat Design” and Nature.
                <br>
                <br>
The reason why I chose those key-words are because I wanted the user to think of those kind of words when looking at my game.
                <br>
                <br>
I made a mood-board for each keyword and then a style-tile which implemented elements from each mood-board.
                <br>
</p>
        <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani8.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani9.png" alt="">
            <div>
                <p>
                    We were allowed to have music in this project, so I decided to remix the ending-theme song from Plants VS Zombies since I know how to make music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
I was planning to sing the lyrics but I decided to re-place my singing with an orchestra.
<br>
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Log book</h2>
            <div class="text_img">
                <p>
                    Once again we had to make a log book, but I forgot to log it everyday and only ended up doing it for the first week.
                </p>
            <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani10.png" alt="">
            </div>            

            <h2>Advancing in Javascript</h2>
            <div class="img_text">
                <img src="../Assets/annimation_asset/ani1.png" alt="">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the project, I ended up having a javascript with 640 lines of code, which sounds overwhelming but it honestly ended up being pretty easy to navigate with how much we’ve learned about javascript.
                        <br>
                        <br>
From using doc.queryselector to just using Const names instead.
                        <br>
                        <br>
We also learned about using “this” tag to refer to the selected element that has been ineteracted with.
                    </p>
                </div>
                </div>
    
                <h2>Reflecting on the project</h2>
                <div class="text_img">
                    <p>
                        My biggest problem I had with my game in the end is how big my containers were compared to the sprites, and I never found out on how to scale it properly. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So the icons are so big compared to the window you are playing in which makes the a bit difficult you can easily miss-click on the wrong element.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But other than that I should also have worked more on the start screen, end screen and the scoreboard as I wasn’t fully satisfied with how they turned out.

                <p>
                    In every course so far, we’ve been working independently 
                    and only really interacted with each other when it came to getting data 
                    on our research such as our likert-scale, 5-second test, surveys and think-aloud test.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So for this course we were finally put into teams to try to see what it’d be like to work in groups.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were working in groups of four.

        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    The passion project was mainly
                    <br>
                    about learning about working
                    <br>
                    with a client and how to
                    <br>
                    edit a video for a client.

            <p>
                For this project we had to work with clients, and luckily for us our school is very central in Copenhagen, giving us a lot of options, but we ended up with a client that one of my group members knew who’s a passionate painter.
                <br>
                <br>
                After choosing our client we would then prepare storyboard, the questions and give roles to each member.

            During the editing process we learned about color grading, but I went a step further and also added in a small animation with keyframes.age of .SVG file was amazing as our illustrations was now vector based so nothing would be lost on the picture quality when we’d change the size of it.

                    For the video, we then had to make a website for the video.
                    <br><br>
                    We had also taken pictures which would be included on the website..
                    <br><br>
                    The teachers taught us about a new file-type that can be included on our passion website and future websites called Lottiefile. Which we would use Adobe After Effects to make.
                    <br><br>
                    Through uploading a video on the website we learned about the iframe tag.

                The passion Project was really fun, as I got to utilize my self-taught skills in videoediting and music making (i used my own music in my video).
                <br>
                <br>
                Though as we were in group of 4, and had to be split in 2 and 2. Where each sub-group would then go out to record a video and audio, my partner was sick so I didn’t get to experience that part of the production. So got the other sub-groups’ videofiles and made my passion video out of their recordings.

                The two projects were during the same course but for this project, 
                <br>
                as the name suggestswe had to work for a company/brand.
                <br>
                Where we would have a contact-person from said company,
                <br>
                and had to work on their want and needs to a re-branding.
            </p>

                            As the same in the Passion Project, we had a lot of companies and brands around our university as we are central to Copenhagen. 
<br><br>
So me and my group made a discussion of what we could choose as our company for this project, and the same person as for the Passion project had someone we could get in contact with once again.
<br><br>
Her own father and his band!

                With our contact person from the band. We would first analyze their current website, then each make our own moodboard on what wanted the new website to look like, make a style-tile based on or own moodboards and then get in contact with our contact person and get feedback.
<br><br>
                We would then mix and match the feedback on each style-tile and combine all the feedback into a finalized style-tile and get feedback one last time and then make changed accordingly.

        <h2>Working in a group</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            Since we were working in a group meant that we had to learn new techniques in order to communicate with each other.
            <br><br>
            First we made a group-contract based on a discussion we had as a group, then we would create a groupchat in Microsoft teams.
            <br><br>
            During this course we learned about SCRUM and the usage of Trello.

            A part of our assigmnent was that our new websoite would have a page/html-file for each member, meaning there in total would be 4 HTML files to work on.
            <br><br>
            With that being said, we also learned how to code as a group in github and merging.

              I got really challenged during the coding of this website as I had to make special kind of animated gallery which I haven't done before.
              So I ended up making an alternative version compared to the one we had designsed as it was too ambitious compared to my abilities.
              <br><br>
              We also had a lot of issues when it came to mergin all of our pages together as a lot of our style css files would overlap with each other.
