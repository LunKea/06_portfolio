        <p>The intro week started out with us creating our domain, which you are on now!
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the week we would learn more about the basics of webdomains through filezilla and HTML structure in VSCode.
            <br>
            <br>
            We did that while having our first assignment/project with the deadline being at the end of the week, which was making a video in randomized groups.

        <h2>The goal for the intro project </h2>
        <div class="project_description_intro">
            <p>During the first week of university, we got assigned randomized groups working on an introduction video, our task was to include everyone in the group in the video and introduce ourselves. 
                <br>
                My group and I was inspired by the movie “Inside Out” made by Disney Pixar where we had a main character experiencing different emotions on the first day of school, and the rest of us would represent different emotions such as:
            </p>    
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Emberassment</li>
            <li>Jealousy</li>
            <li>Sadness</li>
            <li>Joy</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Learning the process of making videos</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            During the project we learned about various techniques and skills for making a video, we learned about framing techniques, how to brainstorm through briefing and think/creative-discussion into choosing the idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            After choosing an idea we learned about storyboard, moodboard (for video elements) and mindmapping.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also learned about video composition and briefly about copyright on music.

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            It was a really fun project to make a video with other people, as I’ve mostly only experienced making videos on my own, it was a fresh experience doing it with other people and also getting to know my classmates!
            <br>
            <br>
            And it was amazing to learn about the process of making videos, as I am self-taught my knowledge beforehand is quite limited but I was able to learn something new that I can use in my own personal work now, especially framing-techniques
            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="text_btn">
                <p>
                    Prior to starting in university, I’ve had experience in making Visual Novels with Python as my coding language, so learning HTML and CSS was very fun and interesting.

                    <br>
                    During this course we learned about:

            <h2>The goal for the first project </h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    For the first project, as an introduction to HTML and CSS, we had to make a website using those type of files, 
                    following wireframes and layout-diagrams that we were handed by the teachers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were also told to make the website mobile-first and make it responsive so i can be on mobile and desktop.
                    <br>
                </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Layout-Diagrams</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            In this course, we were introduced to layout-diagrams, which was my first time seeing but i could easily understand how helpful it is when it comes to coding and found it really handy to have. I learned how to implement this for this project and also how to apply it to future websites/projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            We all had to use the same class, id and layout-diagram. Which helped us in working together in case anyone ran into a problem.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Next to layout-diagrams we learned about wireframes, a concept I’m already familiar with as I’ve made apps before, so I still had something to learn as it was different from when I used it to make apps.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wireframe showcases how the product will look like with headers, paragraphs and images. This wireframe we were handed was heavily focused on grids, as we were also introduced to CSS grids in this project.
            <br>
            <br>
            As practice for CSS grids, we did a lot of CSS grid exercises with hints on how to solve the exercises. In my opinion the exercises helped a lot and prepared me well.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            I also learned about doing mobile-first when it comes to making a responsive website, as it helps out with the process of making a website, since the mobile-version is most likely going to be the simpler version of the website, plus making sure that a burger menu can be implemented later.
            <br>
            <br>
            Doing mobile-first also just helps with transitioning from mobile to desktop, as the mobile-setup can sometime easily transfer to desktop if the website is responsive.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Responsiveness and mediaquery</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            In mobile-first i mentioned making the website responsive, but i didn’t mention how you do that. Through the CSS file you write a mediaquery, which will make a rule dependent on the width or height, but we used width. So dependent on the width of the browser, the layout will change.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future it can later be used for: Desktop into tablet into phone.
            <br>
            <br>
            Media query also helps with changing styles such as font-size and image size depending on what device you view the website on.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Making galleries with CSS and grids</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            With the CSS grid exercises we did, we ended up using them for the gallery of the website, with span and placement within a grid.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was pretty simple to understand, especially because the exercises made me familiar with the concept of how to place and span images across the grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            I noticed some of my classmates struggled with it when it came to making it, they had to end up drawing up the span but I could undestand it to the point of knowing how to make it from the get go, though I do have to admit I did run into some problems when it came to spanning on height.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            As I was completely new to this I did struggle a lot with understanding how CSS grids worked in the beginning but as I kept struggling in the end I learned how to utilize CSS grids.
            <br>
            <br>
            My biggest challenge during this course was actually learning to set up my HTML as I originally made my HTML really weird and complex to the point where no one could help me, so I had to re-do my HTML. But doing so I learned how to use the section and div tag properly and how to make grids!
            <br>
            <br>
            One other challenge I also had throughout this course was using the flex property.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
            Ohter than setting up HTML and CSS grids, we learned a lot of CSS properties which I had a lot of fun with. We learned how to make hover effects, how to link websites through text, image properties in CSS, how to make a footer/header and my favorite part: how to insert fonts.
            <br>i
            <br>
            We also learned how to make our website responsive so it can work both on desktop and mobile.

                <p>
                    Before starting on uni, I made my own website through WIX studio. 
                    But back then I had to remake an ugly website, make it prettier and then get feedback on the newer website vs the old one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile here I could do whatever I want and had to figure everything
                    on my own, which was awesome!
                    <br>

            <h2>The goal for UX project</h2>
        <div class="project_description">
                <p>
                    We had to learnr about making a website from the ground up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Doing the idea-generating, user-research, user-tests, lofi into

                    hi-fi into the final product.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We then had to make a presentation about
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    our website at the end of the project.
                    <br>

        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                During this project we had to write some sort of dairy to keep track of our progress.
                <br>
                <br>
                I split mine in small notepads on Figma and would make on notepad per week and then write about my days within the weekly-notepad.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s pretty hand to see how you did in earlier projects and compare it to future projects, not only to see your own improvement but also to double-check if you are doing everything you’ve done before in the past.
                <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Choosing a topic and the purpose</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
        <p>
            So the topic/theme of my website was for this Manga (Japanese Comic) that I am a fan of called: “The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At all”
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason why I chose it is because I thought it could be a really fun website to create, as I am heavily involved with the community around the product and it has a very strong and distinctive visual identity which is one of the reason why i’m a fan.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I figured out the purpose of the website should be some sort of guide on how to read it online and how to get the physical version of the manga as well, since this manga just recently released physically when i made the website.
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>


        <h2>User-type, target audience & user stories</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            First thing I did after deciding what website to make, I went to look at other websites with the same purpose as mine and stumbled upon a guide on how to buy the manga-series: “LOVE BULLET”. Which is a very similar product to mine as both mangas have the audiences that align with each other, being the LGBTQ community.
            <br>
            <br>
            I then created, user-types on my target audience and user stories.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Early research (Lo-fi)t</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                During the process I made a very early prototype in Figma of the website, and did my first think-aloud test, to see how the website layout I had created already would be perceived and I would make changes accordingly to the feedback I got.
                <br>
            </p>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="iframe_container">
        <iframe class="iframe_sprite" 
        style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"

        allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
        </div>



        <h2>Moodboard</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Once I got my feedback, we then learned about making moodboards based on keywords you chose, in this project we were told to pick 3 key-words.
            <br>
            <br>
            I really like this method as I find it really helpful to narrow down how you want your website/product to look like, especially with the key-words in mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            We were told to pick 3 but I ended up using 2, as those 2 keywords was the most important to my product’s identity.

            I ended up making the website based on the key-words: Comic and Music.
            <br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Style Tile</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <div>
        <p>
            After getting feedback on the moodboard I would then create a style tile based on how the website would look, showcasing the:
            <ul>
                <li>Header navigation bar</li>
                <li>Header1 and font</li>
                <li>Paragraph and font</li>
                <li>The Buttons(CTAs)</li>
                <li>Layout of the landing page</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I also created the style tile based on a moodboard of the product itself, which included the colors, textures, accents and small details.
                    <br>
                </p>
                </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
        <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Finalized style tile</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I had two versions of my style tile, so to find out which version to go with I would create a 5-second test, also to see what the visitor’s first impression of the website was.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found the 5-second test to be an amazing data-collection on first impression and what gets noticed first by people who visits the website, it could narrow down if i my intentions correctly or not. As my website had a strong color, I wanted to figure out if people felt like it was very harsh to look at on first impression, because if it was then it wouldn’t be a pleasing experience on a longer visit.
                <br>
            </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Hi-fi prototype</h2>
        <div class="text_img">
            <p>
                After all of my research I would then create a hi-fi prototype of the website, where I would apply all of my CSS styles and write the text that would be on the website too.
                <br>
                <br>
            I then did think-aloud test on my target audience, reaching out to them on X.com and asking for people to participate where I would give them a shout out on my own account after. This felt really amazing as I was actually able to get in contact with my target audience like I wanted to and didn’t just use my social circle for the testing.
                <br>
                <br>
                I got amazing feedback from the community and made changes accordingly to it.
                <br>

        </div>

        <h2>Finalized style tile</h2>
        <div class="img_text">
            <img src="../Assets/pfp.jpg" alt="">
            <div>
                <p>
                    I would then proceed to make the website itself, where I would apply and pretty much copy-paste everything I made in my Hi-Fi with the feedback in mind.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The website ended up using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>CSS Animations</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And my favorite part, a .nav icon!
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection on the project</h2>
            <div class="text_img">
                <p>
                    This project was honestly my favorite, as I got to create a website based on my own interesting which made me really engaged and passionate about this project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I loved every second of it as I also got to interact more with the community I am a part of and got to meet lots of people through it!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though I did struggle one some parts, my menu originally was supposed to have an animation when you clicked on the vinyl, when you clicked on a vinyl that wasn’t lifted up, the current lifted up vinyl would then slide to where you clicked and the previous one would go down. I couldn’t impliment it as I didn’t know how and didn’t have the time to find out either as I ran into a lot of issues with my gallery as well.
